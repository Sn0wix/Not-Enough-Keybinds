Vanilla minecraft has some basic keybinds, but it's not enough (for some people at least)!
NotEnoughKeybinds mod adds lots of somewhat useful keybindings and a decent keybinding preset system.

# Inventory Management

- ## Throw Ender Pearl
  If you have an ender pearl on your inventory, you can throw it using this binding.

- ## Swap Totem of Undying and Shield
  Quickly swap totem and shield when you are holding them. You can even use this as **"manual" auto totem**.

- ## Equip Elytra (auto elytra)
  Equip an elytra with one key and start flying. When you press that key again, chestplate is equipped back. If this
  keybinding is bound to the same key as jumping is, the autodetect feature is turned on, meaning, you can jump in the
  air as if you had an elytra, and the elytra is equipped. Upon landing, your chestplate is swapped back.

# Chat/Command Hotkeys

# Keybind Presets

You can save and load as many presets as you'd like. You can even use hotkeys, to load them mid-game.

# Building keys

The most useful binding from this category is called **Air Place** Yes, you can use this to **place blocks in the air**.
